- more leniency before pieces are committed when they collide (not sure how yet)
-- it's hard to survive at high levels, gotta study other tetris implementations

- Add a real game over flow
- Input hints on intro screen

POLISH
- Committing pieces
-- Animate color flash on committed piece
-- Add some particles to accompany the flash
-- Add commit sfx
-- Slightly displace stage downards

- Level up
-- Animated "level up!" text
-- Fade/interpolate between themes?

- Line clear
-- Animated block drop rather than teleporting into place
-- Something more interesting than flashing presentation

- improve theme palettes
- some kind of stage bg
