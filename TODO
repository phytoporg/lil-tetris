- Begin piece spawn above the grid
-- Can probably get rid of spawn waiting logic as well?
- More leniency before pieces are committed when they collide (not sure how yet)

- real game over presentation and sequence
- input hints on intro screen
- particles on quick drop
- more presentation on level up
-- Animated "level up!" text
-- Fade/interpolate between themes?
- more presentation on line clear
-- animated block drop rather than teleporting into place
-- something more interesting than flashing presentation
